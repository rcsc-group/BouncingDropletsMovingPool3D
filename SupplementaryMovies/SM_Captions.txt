Supplementary Movie 1: Droplets of 2 cSt silicone oil of radius R = 0.230 mm impact a bath of the same fluid moving with horizontal speed U = 35 cm/s. The vertical impact velocity is increased from top to bottom (V = 59.3, 60.7 cm/s) leading to a transition from bouncing to coalescence. Recorded at 5,400 frames per second.

Supplementary Movie 2: Direct numerical simulation animation of a 2 cSt silicone oil droplet with radius R = 0.230 mm impacting with vertical velocity V = 60.3 cm/s onto a static liquid pool (in the bouncing regime). The left panel showcases the full computational domain and illustrates drop-gas and bath-gas interfaces, as well as the adaptive grid overlaid on two domain boundaries. The colors indicate the norm of the velocity field in the respective regions. The right panel illustrates the drop-gas and pool-gas interfaces from the viewpoint of the symmetry plane, as well as the dimensionless time evolution within the simulation.

Supplementary Movie 3: Direct numerical simulation animation of a  2 cSt silicone oil droplet with radius R = 0.230 mm impacting with vertical velocity V = 60.3 cm/s onto a pool moving with a bath speed of 15 cm/s (in the bouncing regime). The left panel showcases the full computational domain and illustrates drop-gas and bath-gas interfaces, as well as the adaptive grid overlaid on two domain boundaries. The colors indicate the norm of the velocity field in the respective regions. The right panel illustrates the drop-gas and pool-gas interfaces from the viewpoint of the symmetry plane, as well as the dimensionless time evolution within the simulation.

Supplementary Movie 4: Droplets of 2 cSt silicone oil of radius R = 0.230 mm impact a bath of the same fluid with vertical impact velocity V = 73.1 cm/s with increasing bath speed from left to right (U = 0, 10, 20 cm/s) leading to a transition from bouncing to coalescence. Recorded at 15,000 frames per second.
